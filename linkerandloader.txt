What is Linker?
A linker is a special program that combines the object files, generated by the compiler/assembler and other pieces of code to originate an executable file that has a .exe extension. In the object file, the linker searches and appends all libraries needed for the execution of the file. It regulates the memory space that will hold the code from each module. It also merges two or more separate object programs and establishes links among them.
